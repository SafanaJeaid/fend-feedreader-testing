# Feed Reader Testing Using Jasmine

This project is the fourth project of FEND. It fullfils the requirements of testing the code correctly given to us by Udacity using Jasmine.

- You can try the code yourself [here!](https://safanajeaid.github.io/fend-feedreader-testing/).
- Also, visit the Jasmine docs if you're interested [here](https://jasmine.github.io).

### this code was coded by Udacity and cloned by me to finish the requirements.
